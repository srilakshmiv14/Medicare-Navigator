Clinical Decision Support System with Interpretable AI
# MediCare Navigator 🏥🤖

> **AI-Powered Clinical Decision Support System**  
> Reducing clinician documentation burden through interpretable artificial intelligence
>
> ## 🎯 Problem Statement

Healthcare professionals spend **40-50% of their time** on documentation and administrative tasks rather than patient care. MediCare Navigator addresses this critical inefficiency by providing:

- **Intelligent Patient Summarization** from clinical records
- **Evidence-Based Treatment Recommendations** with full transparency
- **Explainable AI** using SHAP/LIME for clinical trust
- **Automated Documentation Generation** for SOAP notes

**🚨 Important**: This system uses **ONLY synthetic data** (MIMIC-III, Synthea) and publicly available medical guidelines. All recommendations require clinical validation.
